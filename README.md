Project of a pet-shop where a Rest API is build with Node.JS, to expose the CRUD services of registering customer pet-shop services, dealing with data about the customers, their pets, and the service itself.

Made originally with Express and Mysql, later I changed the architecture to use Sequelize ORM, but this messed things up a bit, and the complete implementation with Sequelize is still pending.

It includes data validation and file streaming.
